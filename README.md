# my_final_project

For my project, I will be analyzing college student mental health data. No packages are necessary to run the analysis right now.


# Execute the analysis

To execute the analysis, from the project folder you can run


Rscript -e "rmarkdown::render('myproject.Rmd')"


This will create a file called myproject.html output in your directory that contains the results.
